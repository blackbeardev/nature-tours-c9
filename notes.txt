The box model
==============

Context - text, images, etc.
Padding - transparent area around the content, inside of the box.
Border - goes around the padding and the content.
Margin - space between boxes.
Fill area - the area that gets filled with background color or background image.

box-sizing: border-box   -    the height and the width will be defined for the entire box, including the padding and
the border and not just for the content area.

What this means is that the paddings and borders that we specify will reduce the inner width of the content area, instead
of adding them to the total height or width of an element.

* The 3 most important box types:

- block-level box:
# The type of the box is always defined by a display property - for block-level boxes, the display property is usually
set to 'block'.
# This type of box will always occupy as much space as possible, which is usually 100% of its parent width. It will also
create line breaks after and before it, meaning that blocks are formatted vertically, one after another.

- inline boxes:
# basically the opposite of block-level boxes, because their content is distributed in lines, meaning that an inline box
only occupies the space that its content actually needs.  They also don't cause line breaks after or in line with them.
# The height and width properties do not apply, which means that we cannot use those properties on the elements that are
inline elements by default.
# We can only specify horizontal paddings and margins.

-inline-block boxes:
# Are technically also inline boxes, but work as a block-level box on the inside.
# Since they're tecnically inline elements, they also use up only their content space and cause no line breaks.
# Since they work as a block-level box on the inside, the box model applies to them just like in the regular
block-level boxes.


BEM
=====

With component-driven design, we try to divide our page into modular components.
The components should be reusable across a project and between different projects.
Components should also be independant so we can use them completely on their own.

BEM - Block Element Modifier

E.g.,

.block {

}

.block__element {

}

.block__element__modifier {

}

* Block - a standalone component that is meaningful on its own.
* Element - a part of a block that has no standalone meaning.
* Modifier - a different version of a block or an element.

The 7-1 Pattern
================
For project architecture.

We have 7 different folders where we put partial SASS files, and then one main SASS file in which we import all of our
partial files into one final compiled CSS stylesheet.

* The 7 folders:

# base/ => where we put the basic product definitions.
# components/  => where we have one file for each component.
# layout/  => where we define the overall layout of the project.
# pages/   => where we have styles for specific pages of the project.
# themes/  => if you want to implement different visual themes.
# abstracts/  => where we put code that doesn't output any CSS, e.g., variables and mixins.
# vendors/  => where all third party CSS goes.
